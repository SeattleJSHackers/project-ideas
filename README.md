# project-ideas
A place to share, flesh out, and join forces on new projects.

### To Participate
 - [Create a new issue](https://github.com/SeattleJSHackers/project-ideas/issues/new) and describe your idea in as much detail as you would like. (Start the issue title with "IDEA:".)
 - [Review the existing ideas](https://github.com/SeattleJSHackers/project-ideas/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=IDEA%3A) and share your thoughts. Do you see an idea you like? One you think would never make it? Leave a comment explaining why!

### Recommendations
 - Include as much detail as possible. How would it work? What problem is it trying to solve? How would it make money? Who would use it?
 - If there are open questions or problems with your idea, call them out! Someone can then reply with suggestions or answers.
 - If you know of existing implementations, share them! Also try to explain how the idea might improve on them.
 - **Be kind**, but don't be afraid to give and receive honest feedback. We should be able to share what we think, both positive and negative, as long as it is **courteous** and **respectful**.
 - Keep your feedback descriptive; it's great that you like an idea (or fine that you dislike it), but it's critical that the ideator know *why*.
 - Don't be afraid to share your ideas. If someone "steals" your idea, there's really two possible outcomes: (1) they fail (so, no harm, no foul -- at least you know what doesn't work), or (2) they succeed (which probably means they were working on it long before you said anything -- they proved the market, so now you have a successful pattern to emulate). Successful businesses take LOTS of sweat. Uber was a thing for years before it really took off! And Uber being successful doesn't mean that Lyft can't compete. In fact, it makes it EASIER for Lyft, since they can fly in Uber's [upwash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_formation). So, forget about the "I'm in stealth mode so no one steals my idea," nonsense. You should be so lucky.
